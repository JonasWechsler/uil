For use by LASA High School.

## Developing
1. Git clone the repository
2. Run ```npm install```
3. A required ```config.js``` file is missing (for security reasons). Contact one of the developers for this file.
4. Put the file in the root directory of the project.
5. Run ```npm start``` or ```supervisor app``` (if you're cool). But seriously, consider ```npm start```. It builds character. What are you going to put on your resume - "I lazily ran ```supervisor app``` once and never again" or "Every day I restarted the server typing ```npm start``` 5000+ times?
