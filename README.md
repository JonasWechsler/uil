# UIL Computer Science Practice Site
##### A practice site designed by Clayton Petty, Jonas Wechsler, Beck Goodloe, Evan Tey, Neil Patil, and Ryan Rice
For use by LASA High School.

## Developing
1. Git clone the repository
2. Run ```npm install```
3. A required ```config.js``` file is missing (for security reasons). Contact one of the developers for this file.
4. Put the file in the root directory of the project.
5. Run ```npm start``` or ```supervisor app``` (if you're cool).
